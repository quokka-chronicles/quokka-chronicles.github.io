# The Shifting Hunters
The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and blooming Acacia, was a comforting blanket. Within the dense undergrowth of the Melaleuca thicket, a nameless quokka joey nestled deep in its mother's pouch, the rhythmic thump of her heartbeat a steady lullaby. Dusk was bleeding into night, the time when the mob, a collection of some twenty individuals, would begin to stir. The mother, a seasoned forager with a tail well-padded from lean seasons, shifted, her coarse, grey-brown fur rustling against the dry leaves. Her ears, perpetually alert, swiveled, catching the faint rustle of a distant Setonix as it prepared for its nocturnal browse.

For the joey, the world was a symphony of muffled sounds and swaying darkness within the maternal pouch. It knew the warmth, the faint scent of chewed cud, and the gentle sway as its mother adjusted her position. Soon, the familiar hop-and-bound gait would begin, carrying them along the well-worn pathways that crisscrossed their territory – intricate tunnels through the scrub, known only to the quokkas. These paths, often appearing to shorten or lengthen with the turning of the seasons, were simply part of the ancient wisdom passed down through generations, a secret understanding of how their world unfolded.

Tonight, however, a different kind of shift began. It started as a low hum, a sound that seemed to vibrate not just through the ground, but through the very air itself. It was a sound the mother had learned to recognize, a deep, unsettling thrum that preceded certain anomalies. Her ears flattened slightly. The hum was followed by a flicker in the periphery of her vision – a patch of Gahnia that seemed to briefly shimmer, its usual green momentarily replaced by a shade that didn't quite exist. She dismissed it, as quokkas had learned to dismiss such things. It was just the way the light sometimes played tricks, or the way the air felt when the big, bright sphere in the sky had just dipped below the horizon.

But then, a scent hit her. Not the familiar musk of a foraging bandicoot, nor the sharp tang of a snake. This was a scent like ozone and damp fur, starkly alien, sharp enough to prickle the very air, and it seemed to drown all other familiar notes. Her nostrils flared, her small, dark eyes scanning the deepening shadows. The hum intensified, a low growl now accompanying it, a sound that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once.

Suddenly, a shadow detached itself from the deeper darkness. It was a Canis, much larger than the strongest quokka, its form sleek and powerful. But this was not a typical Canis lupus dingo. Its eyes, even in the near-total darkness of the undergrowth, seemed to glow with an internal, cold light, reflecting no external source. And then, something occurred that no quokka had ever witnessed. The Canis was there, a low snarl rumbling in its chest, and in the next blink, it was closer, having covered a distance that defied any natural movement. It hadn't run; it had simply appeared.

Panic, a primal, cold surge, flooded the mother's small body. This was a hunt unlike any other. These were the shifting hunters, the ones whose movements were unpredictable, whose presence seemed to fold the very space around them. Her powerful hind legs coiled, and she launched herself forward, a blur of grey-brown fur.
    
The chase was a nightmare of impossible angles and distorted perceptions. The mother, driven by instinct and the desperate need to protect the life in her pouch, bounded through the familiar pathways. She aimed for a shortcut she knew intimately, a narrow gap between two ancient Eucalyptus roots, willing it to shorten, to fold space as it sometimes did for the mob. For a fleeting moment, it seemed to work, the passage compressing, pulling her through with unnatural speed. But the advantage was momentary. Behind her, the growls of the shifting hunters echoed, sometimes seeming to come from directly behind, sometimes from both sides at once, as if multiple predators were converging from impossible points. She glimpsed one of them, its form briefly blurring, a faint, shimmering afterimage lingering where it had been just moments before. It was gaining.

Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic drumbeat. The joey, jostled violently within the pouch, began to whimper, its tiny claws instinctively clutching at the soft fur. The mother knew the ancient, terrible truth. When a quokka mother is pushed to the absolute brink, when the threat is overwhelming and escape seems impossible, a desperate, final survival mechanism can activate. Her muscles, strained to their limit, suddenly relaxed around the opening of her pouch. It was not a conscious decision, but a physiological response to extreme duress, a last, terrible gamble.

With a sudden, sickening lurch, the joey was expelled. It tumbled out, a small, helpless bundle of fur, landing with a soft thud on the damp earth. Its whimpers turned into a high-pitched squeal, a sound designed by nature to draw attention, to distract.

The mother did not look back. Her momentum carried her forward, a desperate, blurring streak of grey disappearing into the distorted shadows of the Melaleuca thicket, leaving the joey alone on the forest floor.

The high-pitched squeals of the abandoned joey cut through the night. The hum intensified, closer now. The glowing eyes of the shifting hunters materialized out of the darkness, not running, but simply there, surrounding the small, vulnerable creature. The joey, disoriented and terrified, could only stare up as the impossible forms closed in.
